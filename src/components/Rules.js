        <p>This sudoku app has all the same rules of normal sudokus we all know and love. However, these particular puzzles may look a little different because they do not start off as symmetrical puzzles. As a result, they may have multiple solutions. When you input a number that clearly doesn't fit, it will turn pink. Happy solving!</p>
